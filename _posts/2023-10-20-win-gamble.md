Some posts that I found interesting and I put them in this page, I will keep update this list frequently.

1. Can we win money in gambling? 

The short answer is you **can't**. 

Here is a nice [post](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/paradox/chapters/probability_from_independence/probability_from_independence.html) that explains why.[^fn1]

2. Intro to GWAS

If you are interested in Genomics, my friend Edgar has an excellent post [here](https://emarro.github.io/posts/ml-in-bio/) [^fn2].
