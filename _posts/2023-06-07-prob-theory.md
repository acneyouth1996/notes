This is a brief introduction/cheatsheet to probability theory.


1. Basics
    1. $\sigma$ -algebra and measure theory
        You probably don't need to know this.
    2. Rules of probability
    3. Independence
    4. Random variables
    5. Distribution functions
    6. Densities
2. Transformation and Expectation
3. Common family of distribution
4. Joint, marginal, and conditional distributions (Multivariate distribution)
5. Convergence in probability
    You probably don't need to know too much details about this.
