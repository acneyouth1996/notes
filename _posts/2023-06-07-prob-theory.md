This is a brief introduction/cheatsheet to probability theory.


# Basics
## $$\sigma$$-algebra and measure theory
You probably don't need to know this.
test mathjax $$\sigma$$
more test inline equation 
\$$
    1 = 2
$$
## Rules of probability
## Independence
## Random variables
## Distribution functions
## Densities
# Transformation and Expectation
# Common family of distribution
# Joint, marginal, and conditional distributions
# Convergence in probability
You probably don't need to know too much details about this.
