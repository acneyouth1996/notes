This is a brief introduction/cheatsheet to probability theory.


## Basics
### $$\sigma$$-algebra and measure theory
You probably don't need to know this.
test mathjax $$\sigma$$
more test inline equation 
\$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}

### Rules of probability
### Independence
### Random variables
### Distribution functions
### Densities
## Transformation and Expectation
## Common family of distribution
## Joint, marginal, and conditional distributions
## Convergence in probability
You probably don't need to know too much details about this.
