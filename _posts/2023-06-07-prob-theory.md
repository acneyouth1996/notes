This is a brief introduction/cheatsheet to probability theory. Most of the content is from the book "Statistical Inference" [^fn1]


## Basics
I assume you have some basic idea of set theory such as what is intersection and what is union.
### $$\sigma$$-algebra and measure theory
You probably don't need to know this. But in case you need it, here is the definition of $$\sigma$$-algebra. 

A collection of subsets $$\S$$ is called **sigma algebra**, denoted by $$\mathcal{B}$$, if it satisfies the follwoing three conditions:
1. $$\emptyset \in \mathcal{B}$$

### Rules of probability
### Independence
### Random variables
### Distribution functions
### Densities
## Transformation and Expectation
## Common family of distribution
## Joint, marginal, and conditional distributions
## Convergence in probability
You probably don't need to know too much details about this.
